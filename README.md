## Hello World!
### W1
Write your W1 activity Devlog here.

### W2
1. Why are the r, g, and b variables floats instead of ints, bools, or strings?
    The rgb values needed to store numbers with decimals that can be used with operators,
    which the other datatypes cannot do.
    
2. Why is the _bounce variable an int instead of a float, bool, or string?
    Integers contain whole numbers, which _bounce is, so here is no need for decimals.
    Booleans and strings cannot hold operatable numbers.

3. The error you got after Step 4 of Part 2 told you something useful about why that line of code was broken- what was it?
    Always put a semi-colon at the end of your line!!!!


### W3
Table# 15
private int brightness;

void SetLightDimness(int sanity)
{
    brightness = sanity; //or something, we didn't have to do the body
}
